## Predicting Hotel Cancellations with Machine Learning 🏨📈

The purpose of this project is to predict hotel cancellations for two separate Portuguese hotels (H1 and H2). 
Included in the GitHub repository are the datasets and notebooks for all models run.

Throughout this project, I followed these steps:
* Understanding the Problem Statement
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Preprocessing
